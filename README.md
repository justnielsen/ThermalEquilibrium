ThermalEquilibrium
==================

A small test of component-oriented modeling with Modelica.

The package "ThermalEquilibrium" models a classical physics laboratory setup consisting of

 - glass of water
 - convective heat transfer
 - weights to be placed in the glass of water
 
A simulation of one or more instances of the "Weight" class connected via "convective heat transfer" 
instances to an instance of the "GlassOfWater" class will show how the temperatures of the component 
will approach each other over time.

This example is public.
